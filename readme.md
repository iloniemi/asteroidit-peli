# Asteroids game

## Basic info
This is a project for me to practice java and have fun trying to implement aspects of real physics to collisions. Objects have mass and velocity which are taken into consideration in collisions. In a collision between a small and a large object, the smaller object needs to have high velocity to alter the course of the larger object in a significant manner.

## Current state
Project isn't currently being worked on actively.

### Done
Ship can move, shoot and destroy asteroids.
Larger asteroids break apart into smaller smaller asteroids.
Point counter counts destroyed asteroids.
Collision physics is implemented.
